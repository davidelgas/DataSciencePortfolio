Data availability.
Datasets are suprisingly hard to come by. They either use inconcistent collection methods 1, or are aggregated data intended to support a Point of View. 
In addition to the efforts during the U.S. Census, Los Angeles conducts an annual effort called "HOMELESS POPULATION POINT-IN-TIME COUNT". 
This effort by Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) appears to be a manual count by volnteers. 
The details of this sampling stategy are unclear. 2
