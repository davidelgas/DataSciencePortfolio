Data availability.
Datasets are suprisingly hard to come by. They either use inconcistent collection methods 1, or are aggregated data intended to support a Point of View. 
In addition to the efforts during the U.S. Census, Los Angeles conducts an annual effort called "HOMELESS POPULATION POINT-IN-TIME COUNT". 
This effort by Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) appears to be a manual count by volnteers. 
The details of this sampling stategy are unclear. 2

In HUD's terminology, "Sheltered ES Homeless" refers to individuals or families who are experiencing homelessness and are accessing Emergency Shelter (ES) services. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

In HUD's terminology, "Sheltered ES Homeless" refers to individuals or families who are experiencing homelessness and are accessing Emergency Shelter (ES) services. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Sheltered: This term indicates that the individuals or families are receiving housing services through a shelter facility. Shelters provide temporary accommodations for people experiencing homelessness, often including overnight stays, meals, and supportive services.

ES (Emergency Shelter): Emergency shelters are facilities that provide immediate, short-term housing and services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness. ES programs are designed to address the immediate needs of people who may be facing a housing crisis or emergency situation.

Homeless: This term refers to individuals or families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. It includes people who are living in shelters, transitional housing, or places not meant for human habitation (e.g., streets, cars, abandoned buildings).

Therefore, "Sheltered ES Homeless" specifically describes individuals or families who are temporarily residing in emergency shelters due to homelessness. This category is part of HUD's broader efforts to track and address homelessness through data collection, including the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) and the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). Understanding the characteristics and needs of individuals accessing emergency shelter services is essential for informing homeless assistance programs, policy development, and resource allocation.

In HUD's terminology, "Sheltered TH Homeless" refers to individuals or families who are experiencing homelessness and are accessing Transitional Housing (TH) services. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Sheltered: Similar to "Sheltered ES Homeless," this term indicates that the individuals or families are receiving housing services through a shelter facility. In this case, it specifically refers to transitional housing facilities.

TH (Transitional Housing): Transitional housing programs provide temporary housing and supportive services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Unlike emergency shelters, which offer immediate short-term accommodations, transitional housing programs typically offer longer-term stays (up to 24 months) along with services such as case management, life skills training, and counseling. The goal of transitional housing is to help individuals and families stabilize their housing situations and transition to permanent housing.

Homeless: As mentioned earlier, this term refers to individuals or families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.

Therefore, "Sheltered TH Homeless" specifically describes individuals or families who are temporarily residing in transitional housing facilities due to homelessness. This category is another aspect of HUD's efforts to track and address homelessness through data collection, including the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) and the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). Understanding the characteristics and needs of individuals accessing transitional housing services is important for informing homeless assistance programs and policies aimed at facilitating successful transitions to permanent housing.

what about Sheltered SH Homeless

"Sheltered SH Homeless" refers to individuals or families who are experiencing homelessness and are accessing services through Safe Havens (SH). Here's what each term signifies:

Sheltered: As before, "Sheltered" indicates that individuals or families are receiving housing services through a designated facility. In this case, it specifically refers to shelters that are classified as Safe Havens.

SH (Safe Havens): Safe Havens are specialized shelters that cater to individuals experiencing homelessness who may have mental health issues, substance use disorders, or other complex needs. These shelters often provide a low-barrier, supportive environment with access to case management, counseling, and other services tailored to the unique needs of this population. Safe Havens typically offer a more flexible and less structured approach compared to traditional emergency shelters or transitional housing programs.

Homeless: Again, this term refers to individuals or families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.

Therefore, "Sheltered SH Homeless" specifically describes individuals or families who are temporarily residing in Safe Havens due to homelessness. This category is part of HUD's broader efforts to track and address homelessness through data collection, including the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) and the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). Understanding the characteristics and needs of individuals accessing Safe Haven services is crucial for providing appropriate support and resources to this vulnerable population.
