Project Title
Analyzing the Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Homelessness Rates in Downtown Los Angeles, CA: A Multivariate Linear Regression Approach

Project Overview
This project aims to identify and quantify the impact of various socioeconomic, policy, and environmental factors on homelessness rates in Los Angeles, California. 
By employing multivariate linear regression, the study will explore how variables such as unemployment rates, housing affordability, 
social services availability, and others contribute to the homelessness crisis.

Concerns
Scope and timing. I need to stay within the project intent here. I won't solve this issue. 
Should I limit the scope further ? Maybe a single sub-population. Single un-wed mothers is the largest cohort.
Do I have a hypothesis to work from ?? 


Data Sets

Qualitative Data
Can I interview local officials, policymakers, representatives, or any organization working on homelessness ?
Possibly individuals experiencing homelessness, although I know this can get dangerous very quickly.
Can/should I use my experiences from my time living in DTLA or working with the ETC ?
Do I build personas ?

Quantitative Data
Public datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau, HUD, and local Los Angeles government databases for socioeconomic data.
Homelessness rates and demographic information from Los Angeles County's Homeless Services Authority.
Potentially, primary data from interviews with community leaders and observations within Downtown Los Angeles.

Integrating Qualitative Insights with Quantiitative Data
As before, use the qualitative data to find patterns, and then measure them with the quantitative data. 
Analyze the interview transcripts to extract key themes, challenges, and suggested solutions. 
This qualitative analysis can help inform your regression model's variables and provide a deeper understanding of the homelessness dynamics in Downtown Los Angeles.
Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Data: Use insights gained from your interviews and observations to interpret the results of your multivariate linear regression model. For example, if interviewees highlight the lack of affordable housing as a critical issue, examine how housing cost variables interact with homelessness rates in your model.
